A small dashboard application that provides an overview for git-based CI/CD pipelines like GitLab CI. While these tools are awesome, they usually not provide a good overview over multiple pipelines in multiple repositories, at least not for free.

A few alternatives do already exist, but none of them suited my personal needs, especially considering an enterpise context, so I decided to do my own implementation. Maybe it is of use for you aswell ðŸ˜‰.

## Configuration

Since the dashboard is designed to be served from a container, configuration is mainly done via environment variables.

```bash
PIPELINE_DASHBOARD_ENDPOINT=https://my-gitlab-host.com/api/v4
PIPELINE_DASHBOARD_GITLAB_TOKEN=XXX

PIPELINE_DASHBOARD_GROUPS=Test Group 1,Test Group 2

PIPELINE_DASHBOARD_TEST_GROUP_1_SOURCE=gitlab
PIPELINE_DASHBOARD_TEST_GROUP_1_NAMESPACES=some/group
PIPELINE_DASHBOARD_TEST_GROUP_1_USERS=SomeUsername

PIPELINE_DASHBOARD_TEST_GROUP_2_SOURCE=gitlab
PIPELINE_DASHBOARD_TEST_GROUP_2_REPOSITORIES=someRepo1,someRepo2
```

Settings these environment variables and starting the application, will lead to a dashboard with two collapsable groups with pipelines tiles inside of them. Selecting pipelines can be done by either scrapping a "namespace" or a user for all repositories or by manually selecting individual repositories.
